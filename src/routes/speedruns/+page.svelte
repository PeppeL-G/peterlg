<h1>Speedruns</h1>
<p>I sometimes play video games, and since I have a quite bad memory I somewhere want to have a list of which games I have finished. And what better place than on this website? And some games I enjoy playing so much that I play them multiple times, and then they are even more fun to speedrun them, so here you can also see my records. Be impressed! ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<div class="speedruns">
	<table border={1}>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Date Played</th>
				<th>Game</th>
				<th>Time</th>
				<th>Console</th>
				<th>Played On</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			{#each speedruns as speedrun}
				<tr title={speedrun.comment}>
					<td>{speedrun.date}</td>
					<td>{speedrun.game.name}</td>
					<td>
						{speedrun.time.hours}:{speedrun.time.minutes}:{speedrun.time.seconds}
					</td>
					<td>{speedrun.game.consoleName}</td>
					<td>{speedrun.consoleName}</td>
				</tr>
			{/each}
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>
