<h1>Speedruns</h1>
<p>
	I sometimes play video games, and since I have a quite bad memory I somewhere
	want to have a list of which games I have finished. And what better place than
	on this website? So on this page I add an entry each time I finish a game. And
	some games I enjoy playing so much that I play them multiple times, and then
	they are even more fun to speedrun them, so here you can also see my records.
	Be impressed! ðŸ˜Ž
</p>

<p>
	The time <code>??:??:??</code> means that I finished the game without measuring
	how long time it took, most likely because I played it a little bit each day
	over multiple days (sometimes several weeks).

<div class="speedruns">
	<table border={1}>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Date Played</th>
				<th>Game</th>
				<th>Category</th>
				<th>Time</th>
				<th>Console</th>
				<th>Played On</th>

		<tbody>
			{#each speedruns as speedrun}
				
				{@const game = games.find(g => g.id == speedrun.gameId)}
				{@const category = game.categories.find(c => c.id == speedrun.categoryId)}
