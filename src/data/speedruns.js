But when I discovered that temple maps revealed if you had found all Golden Skultas in the temples, things got a lot easier xD And last three heart pieces took a lot of time. Especially the one you win in Bombchu Bowling Alley, because I thought I had already won that one, and when I came back and double checked it didn't show the heart piece as the price, so I assumed I had got it, but some time after that I learned it doesn't give you that price each time xD I also never got the Forest Stage Deku Nut upgrade, because I got the Biggoron's Sword first, and wasn't aware of the bug -.- But I'll consider this 100% anyway.`,
